This activity shows basic linear data structures in Java:
- Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

Each file has the code for these structures and a main program (`DataStructure.java`) shows how they work.


---

## How it works
- Linked List: insert, delete, search, display
- Circular Linked List: like linked list but loops back to head
- Stack: push, pop, peek
- Queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek
